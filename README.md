## Visualize the effect in fit of the linear regression model for a particular dataset with increasing outliers of the dataset. The number of data points can be increased and removed by clicking on the visulaizer (example of what adding or removing datapoint means). This exercise is to show the effect on the fit by varying the number and positioning of the datapoints. You can create a dropdown to add ridge regularizer and lasso regularizer to the linear regression model and show the effect of fit in case of regularizers.
